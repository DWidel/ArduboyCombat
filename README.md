# ArduboyCombat
Atari 2600 Combat for Arduboy

This is some quick throwaway code I wrote to show what was possible on an Arduboy.  It evolved from earlier games so there is some code that may not make sense.  Also, I had to delete everything that wasn't completely necessary to get it to fit, which doesn't help either.

The sprites are increased vertically by 50%.  They already had every line duplicated once, this gives every line 3 times, so when I display every third line they still look good.   I loosened up the collision detection so that they can overlap the walls a little.

There's not enough buttons so I'm using B as a shift.  Shift A is Start and Shift Up is Select.  I should have done something for the difficutly switches but I didn't think of it until now.

I don't plan on updating this project.
